# Voice Based Virtual Trial Room
A technology to simulate a trial room by taking voice input and using it to retrieve relevant clothing from
the DeepFashion-2 dataset and overlaying it on real-time images.

It's built using pytorch framework and has made use of transformers from hugging face and detectron2.

This project is still ongoing and the last part of the code here gives us the location of the file to be overlayed on the real-time image, this is still a work in progress.
